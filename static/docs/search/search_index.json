Select Web from the navigation menu. Click the Add a new web app button. Click next on the first section called Your web app's domain name . Select Django from the list of web frameworks. Select Python 3.8 from the Python version options. Name your project gwc_site and leave the directory as is. Wait a bit while your web app is created. Use git to clone our starter project from GitHub into your work space \u00b6 Select Consoles from the navigation menu. Under Start a new console , select Bash . Enter the following commands into the console. Press enter after each one. rm -rf gwc_site/* git clone https://github.com/escobarj/gwc-2021.git gwc_site Update the code to work with your PythonAnywhere account \u00b6 Select Files from the navigation menu. Browse to the gwc_site/gwc_site folder. Select the settings.py file to open it in a file editor. Find the line ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['escobarj.pythonanywhere.com'] and replace escobarj with your own PythonAnywhere username. Save the file. Select Web from the navigation menu. Click the green reload button. Check that the web site is working by clicking the web link above the reload button. Experiment with html elements \u00b6 <h1> Heading. 1-6 different levels. 1 being the largest \u00b6 <h1>This is a heading</h1> <h2>This is a subheading</h2> <p> Paragraph \u00b6 <p>This is a block of text</p> <a> Anchor, a.k.a link \u00b6 <a href=\"http://www.girlswhocode.com\">Visit this site</a> <br> Line break \u00b6 <p>This is a block of text<br>has a line break in it</p> <img> Image \u00b6 <img src=\"dog.jpg\" alt=\"A cute dog\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\"> <em> Emphasis, a.k.a italics \u00b6 <p>This <em>word</em> will be emphasized in italics.</p> <strong> Strong, a.k.a bold \u00b6 <p>This <strong>word</strong> will be bold.</p> More html tags here Experiment with css \u00b6 CSS color pallet Exercise 2 \u00b6 How to compare things in Python \u00b6 https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/#compare-things Experiment with the \"word count\" page \u00b6 Log into your PythonAnywhere account. Go to the Console section and open a bash console. Type the following commands cd gwc_site git pull Go to the Files section. Open separate browser tabs for each of the following files; gwc_site/gwc/views.py gwc_site/gwc/templates/gwc/count.html gwc_site/gwc/templates/gwc/result.html Experiment with changes to the count and result fucntions in views.py Experiment with changes to the count.html and result.html html template files Exercise 3 \u00b6 Use the info and code snippets below to create new pages for our website. Create a new page \u00b6 Add a route so your new page can be found. In this example we'll add a page called events . Add a new path to gwc_site/gwc/url.py urlpatterns = [ ... path ( 'events/' , views . events , name = 'events' ), ] Add a new function in gwc_site/gwc/views.py def count ( request ): context = { 'nav_events' : 'active' } return render ( request , 'gwc/events.html' , context ) Add a the new events page to the navigation bar in gwc_site/gwc/templates/gwc/base.html < li class = \"nav-item\" > < a class = \"nav-link {{ nav_events }}\" href = \"{% url 'events' %}\" > Events </ a > </ li > Create a new html file gwc_site/gwc/templates/gwc/events.html and enter the starter code below {% extends 'gwc/base.html' %} {% load static %} {% block content %} <!-- The body of the page goes here between the \" {% block content %} \" and {% endblock %} --> {% endblock %} Reload your site so django can see that a the new page was added. Add content \u00b6 After you have the new page created, you need to add the text, images, links, etc that will be the content of your new page. You can use the html elements from exercise 2 and the new snippets below as a templates to add to you page. You can add images either by uploading to gwc_site/static/images/ or using a web link to an image already on the web. All the examples below can be seen here Small Image Card \u00b6 < div class = \"card\" style = \"width: 18rem;\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" class = \"card-img-top\" alt = \"Picture of a dog\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Card title </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content. </ p > < a class = \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href = {% url 'home' %} > Home</a > </ div > </ div > Large Image Card \u00b6 < div class = \"card mb-3\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" class = \"card-img-top\" alt = \"Picture of a dog\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Card title </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer. </ p > < p class = \"card-text\" >< small class = \"text-muted\" > Last updated 3 mins ago </ small ></ p > </ div > </ div > Horizontal Image Card \u00b6 < div class = \"card mb-3\" style = \"max-width: 800px;\" > < div class = \"row g-0\" > < div class = \"col-md-4\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" alt = \"...\" > </ div > < div class = \"col-md-8\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Card title </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > This is a wider card with supporting text to the side as a natural lead-in to additional content. This content is a little bit longer. </ p > < p class = \"card-text\" >< small class = \"text-muted\" > Last updated 3 mins ago </ small ></ p > </ div > </ div > </ div > </ div > Card Group \u00b6 This example is a 3 card grouping, you can add or remove cards as needed. < div class = \"card-group\" > < div class = \"card\" style = \"width: 18rem;\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" class = \"card-img-top\" alt = \"Picture of a dog\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Small Image Card </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content. </ p > < a class = \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href = {% url 'home' %} > Home</a > </ div > </ div > < div class = \"card\" style = \"width: 18rem;\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" class = \"card-img-top\" alt = \"Picture of a dog\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Small Image Card </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content. </ p > < a class = \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href = {% url 'home' %} > Home</a > </ div > </ div > < div class = \"card\" style = \"width: 18rem;\" > < img src = \" {% static 'images/dog.png' %} \" class = \"card-img-top\" alt = \"Picture of a dog\" > < div class = \"card-body\" > < h5 class = \"card-title\" > Small Image Card </ h5 > < p class = \"card-text\" > Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content. </ p > < a class = \"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href = {% url 'home' %} > Home</a > </ div > </ div > </ div > If you're interested in learning more about all the html elements you can create.
